/*
How this file works:

This function is used to carve out a rectangular room in a grid-based dungeon map. You give it the map, the center point, and the desired room size. It checks the bounds so you don’t accidentally carve off the edge of the map, then sets all the tiles in the rectangle to 0 (which means “floor” or “walkable area”). The math for the bounds uses Math.max and Math.min to clamp the room inside the map and leaves a 1-tile border of walls around the whole map. If the room can’t fit, it just returns null. Otherwise, you get back the actual center of the room as [row, col] so you can use it for connecting corridors or placing stuff.

Math summary:
- The room’s start and end positions are calculated by centering the rectangle on (centerX, centerY) and clamping to the map edges.
- The function uses Math.floor to make sure the room dimensions are whole tiles.
- The final center is recalculated in case the room got shifted by the clamping.
