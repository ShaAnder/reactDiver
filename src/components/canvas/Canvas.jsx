/*
How this file works:

This is a simple React component that renders a <canvas> element and forwards a ref so the parent can access the DOM node directly (for drawing, pointer lock, etc).

- The useEffect ensures that whenever the width or height props change, the actual canvas DOM element's width and height properties are updated. This is important because setting width/height via props or attributes resets the canvas drawing context, so it's best to do it explicitly in JS.
- The ref is forwarded using React.forwardRef, which is necessary for hooks or parent components that want to access the canvas DOM node directly (for rendering, pointer lock, etc).
- The style prop is passed through so you can easily style the canvas from the parent.
